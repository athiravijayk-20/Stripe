# Stripe Payment Integration in PHP

This repository demonstrates how to integrate **Stripe Payments** into a PHP application. It covers steps for backend and frontend integration, creating payment intents, handling Stripe webhooks, and updating the database based on payment success.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **PHP 7.4+**
- **Composer** installed
- **Stripe Account** (for API keys)
- **.env** file to securely store API keys

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up Stripe Payment Integration.

### 1. Install Composer Dependencies

Run the following command to install required libraries:

```bash
composer install
This will install all dependencies including Stripe's PHP SDK and vlucas/phpdotenv for environment variable management.

2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in your project root and add your Stripe API keys:

plaintext
Copy code
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key-here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret-here
Replace the placeholders with your actual keys from the Stripe Dashboard.

3. Backend: Create Payment Intent
The backend will create a PaymentIntent when a payment request is made. The frontend will use the returned client_secret to confirm the payment.

Example of creating a payment intent (create-payment-intent.php):
php
Copy code
// Include Stripe library and initialize API keys
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
\Stripe\Stripe::setApiKey(getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY'));

// Create payment intent with amount (in cents)
$paymentIntent = \Stripe\PaymentIntent::create([
    'amount' => 5000, // Example amount in cents (i.e., $50.00)
    'currency' => 'usd',
]);

// Return the client secret to the frontend
echo json_encode(['clientSecret' => $paymentIntent->client_secret]);
4. Frontend: HTML Form and Stripe.js
On the frontend, you'll use Stripe Elements to collect payment details securely.

Example HTML Form:
html
Copy code
<form id="payment-form">
    <div id="card-element"></div> <!-- Stripe card element -->
    <button id="submit">Pay $50.00</button>
</form>
Stripe JavaScript Integration:
javascript
Copy code
const stripe = Stripe('your-public-key-here');
const elements = stripe.elements();
const card = elements.create('card');
card.mount('#card-element');

document.getElementById('payment-form').addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    const response = await fetch('/create-payment-intent.php', { method: 'POST' });
    const { clientSecret } = await response.json();

    const { paymentIntent, error } = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(clientSecret, {
        payment_method: {
            card: card,
            billing_details: {
                name: 'John Doe',
            },
        },
    });

    if (error) {
        alert('Payment failed: ' + error.message);
    } else if (paymentIntent.status === 'succeeded') {
        alert('Payment successful!');
    }
});
5. Handle Stripe Webhooks (Optional)
Set up a webhook to listen for Stripe events (e.g., payment success or failure). Webhooks help track the status of payments after they have been processed.

Example of webhook handler (webhook.php):
php
Copy code
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$payload = @file_get_contents('php://input');
$sig_header = $_SERVER['HTTP_STRIPE_SIGNATURE'];
$endpoint_secret = getenv('STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET');

$event = null;

try {
    $event = \Stripe\Webhook::constructEvent($payload, $sig_header, $endpoint_secret);
} catch (\UnexpectedValueException $e) {
    http_response_code(400);
    exit();
} catch (\Stripe\Exception\SignatureVerificationException $e) {
    http_response_code(400);
    exit();
}

// Handle the event
switch ($event->type) {
    case 'payment_intent.succeeded':
        $paymentIntent = $event->data->object;
        // Update the database with payment success details
        break;
    // Add more events as needed
    default:
        // Unexpected event type
        http_response_code(400);
        exit();
}

http_response_code(200);
6. Update Database on Payment Success
Once a payment is confirmed, you can update the user's payment status in your database. Make sure to capture the payment details such as:

Transaction ID
Payment Status
Amount Paid
User Information
7. Testing and Deployment
Testing: Use Stripe's test keys and test cards to simulate different payment scenarios in the development environment.
Deployment: When you're ready, switch to live keys and ensure your server uses HTTPS (SSL certificates).
Conclusion
By following these steps, you'll be able to accept payments via Stripe in your PHP application. This integration will securely handle payment details, confirm transactions, and allow you to track payment status with webhooks.
